        <h2>Recent Trip</h2>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I went on a trip to Paris. I fell in love with the city. Now I'm trying to figure out how I'll move there.</p>

            <p>
                One of my absolute favorites — Tortilla Española (or Spanish Tortilla). I love it served cold as it pairs well with almost every beverage that way.
            </p>
            <p>
                My go-to is making it with really good extra-virgin olive oil, thinly sliced potatoes, and an onion. Once set, I let it chill in the fridge. Goes great with arugala-based salads.
